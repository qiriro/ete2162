title: Lab 1 - Basic Course and Grade Management
tldr: "In this lab, we learn the fundamental structure of the grade management system. Students will learn how to create a basic program that stores and manages course information and grades. This first lab teaches essential concepts of using dictionaries and lists in Python, getting input from users, and displaying information back to them. Students will build a simple menu system where users can add new courses, input grades for different types of assessments (quizzes, CATs, and final exams), and view all their stored information. The emphasis is on getting comfortable with basic data structures and input/output operations."
