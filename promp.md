You are an expert web designer tasked with modernizing a Jekyll-based course website template. The template is functional but outdated. Your goal is to transform it into a modern, visually appealing, and user-friendly design while maintaining its core functionality. Please provide specific code suggestions and explanations for the following aspects:

1. Update the typography to use modern web fonts. Suggest specific font choices and provide CSS code to implement them, including a typographic hierarchy.

2. Create a modern color scheme. Provide CSS variables for a color palette including primary, secondary, and accent colors. Include code for a light/dark mode toggle.

3. Improve the layout and whitespace. Show CSS code using Flexbox or Grid to create a responsive layout with increased whitespace.

4. Modernize the navigation. Provide HTML and CSS for a sticky header with a collapsible mobile menu. Include JavaScript for smooth scrolling and active menu item highlighting.

5. Redesign content cards and components. Show HTML and CSS for modern card designs with subtle shadows and hover effects. Include button styles with hover and focus states.

6. Incorporate modern icons and optimize images. Suggest an icon library and show how to implement it. Provide code for lazy loading images.

7. Add subtle animations and transitions. Show CSS and JavaScript code for micro-interactions, page transitions, and attention-drawing animations.

8. Improve forms and interactivity. Provide HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for modernized form elements with real-time validation.

9. Enhance responsive design. Show media queries and CSS for ensuring the design is mobile-first and looks great on all devices.

10. Improve accessibility. Provide code examples for proper color contrast, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation.

11. Optimize performance. Show how to minimize and combine CSS/JS files, implement critical CSS, and use CSS custom properties for theming.

For each suggestion, provide code snippets that can be directly integrated into the Jekyll template structure. Explain your choices and how they contribute to a more modern design. If you need any specific information about the current template structure, please ask.
